# The Riddler's Batman Trivia

## Description

* **The Riddler's Batman Trivia?**
The Riddler's Batman Trivia is a timed quiz game styled with Bootstrap, and programmed with JavaScript and jQuery. Timing events were written in JavaScript, and jQuery was written to manipulate the DOM.

* **How Does The Riddler's Batman Trivia Work?**
The game is a timed Batman-themed trivia quiz with 10 questions. One question is displayed on the screen at a time, along with the timer, which is set to 20 seconds on each question. If the player answers correctly, a congratulatory message is displayed for 10 seconds and then the game proceeds to the next question without user input. If the player fails to answer a question correctly, or within the time limit, a negative message is displayed for 10 seconds and then the game proceeds to the next question without user input. Correct answers, incorrect answers, and questions not answered due to running out of time are all logged on screen for the player to be able to track their performance. At the end of the game, the player wins if they answer 7 or more questions correctly. The message and music that plays at the end of the game depends on the player's performance. The player has the option to click a button to reset the game once it is over.
